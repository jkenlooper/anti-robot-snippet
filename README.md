# Anti-robot Snippet
Include content into a webpage for just the humans that are not robots.

Original implementation that I did for [Awesome Mud Works contact page](http://awesomemudworks.com/contact/) .  

Note that this is mostly a simple demo app and I didn't include some files to
avoid cluttering up the repo.  That being said, it should be easy enough to run
by `pip install -r requirements.txt` and adding your google recaptcha public
and private keys to your env.  See the example *site.cfg* and update as
necessary.

Test files for both the python and javascript code have been included.  The
javascript test code will need it's own compile step which I left out for now.
